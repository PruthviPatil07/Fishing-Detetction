## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PruthviPatil07/Fishing-Detetction.git
   cd Fishing-Detetction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   Navigate to the `NOTEBOOKS/` directory and open `data_preprocessing.ipynb` to preprocess the dataset.

2. **Model Training:**

   Use `model_training.ipynb` to train the machine learning models on the processed data.

3. **Evaluation:**

   Evaluate the performance of the trained models using `evaluation.ipynb`.
